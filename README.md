I'm Thomas. This is my âœ¨professionalâœ¨ GitHub account, which I use to host my website plus repos I want associated with my name. If this account shows days without any commits, it's likely because I'm cooking up gruesome code in private repos on my original account [@GitMew](https://github.com/GitMew/).

- PhD student in natural language processing at the [KU Leuven](https://github.com/kuleuven) in Belgium. I work in the [LAGoM â€¢ NLP](https://www.lagom.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group, which is part of the [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://hci.cs.kuleuven.be/) division at our department of Computer Science.
